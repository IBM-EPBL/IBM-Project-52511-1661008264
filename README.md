# TITLE
Trip Based Modeling of Fuel Consumption in Modern Fleet Vehicles Using Machine Learning<br/>

CATEGORY:
MachineLearning<br/>

Skills Required:
Python,python web frameworks,python for data visualization,data preprocessing techniques,machine learning,IBM cloud,
IBM watson studio,python-flask<br/>

Project Description:
  Ability to model and predict the fuel consumption is vital in enhancing fuel economy of vehicles and preventing fraudulent 
activities in fleet management.Fuel consumption of a vehicle depends on several internal and external factors however,not all these
factors may be measured or available for the fuel consumption analysis.The maim aim of the project is to build machine learning
algorithm to predict the fuel consumption of fleet vehicles based on the gas type.A web application is built which is integrated with 
ML model.<br/>
